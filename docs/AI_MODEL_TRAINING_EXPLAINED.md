# AI Model Training & Architecture - Complete Explanation

## 🤖 Which AI Model is Being Used?

### Current Model: **GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)**

**Location**: `lib/api.ts` line 133
```typescript
model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || "gpt-4o-mini"
```

**Why GPT-4o-mini?**
- ✅ **Fast**: Quick response times (2-5 seconds per article)
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: ~$0.15 per 1M input tokens, ~$0.60 per 1M output tokens
- ✅ **High Quality**: GPT-4 level quality at fraction of cost
- ✅ **Reliable**: Stable API, good uptime
- ✅ **JSON Mode**: Supports structured output (perfect for our use case)

**Alternative Models Available:**
- `gpt-4o` - Higher quality, slower, more expensive
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Balanced option
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Faster, lower quality

**To Change Model**: Set `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o` in `.env.local`

## 🎓 How is the AI "Trained"?

### Important: We're NOT Fine-Tuning

**We use Advanced Prompt Engineering**, not model fine-tuning. Here's why:

### 1. **System Prompt Engineering** (Primary Training Method)

**Location**: `lib/ai/constraints.ts` - `generateSystemPrompt()`

**How It Works:**
- We create **specialized system prompts** that "train" the AI for each task
- The system prompt acts as instructions that guide the AI's behavior
- Different prompts for Investopedia vs NerdWallet styles

**Example System Prompt:**
```
You are a senior financial educator with 20+ years of experience...
- Deep understanding of Indian financial markets (NSE, BSE, RBI, SEBI)
- Expertise in investment products
- Knowledge of regulatory frameworks
...
```

### 2. **Financial Expert Prompts** (Style-Specific Training)

**Location**: `lib/ai/financialExpertPrompts.ts`

**Three Specialized Prompts:**

#### A. Investopedia Prompt (`getInvestopediaPrompt`)
- Trains AI to be educational and authoritative
- Focuses on deep explanations
- Includes regulatory citations
- Academic tone

#### B. NerdWallet Prompt (`getNerdWalletPrompt`)
- Trains AI to be practical and user-friendly
- Focuses on comparisons
- Includes cost analysis
- Conversational tone

#### C. Hybrid Prompt (`getHybridPrompt`)
- Combines both styles
- Educational + Practical

### 3. **Template-Based Training** (Structure Training)

**Location**: `lib/ai/financialTemplates.ts`

**How It Works:**
- Pre-defined content structures
- Each template has specific sections
- AI follows the structure exactly
- Ensures consistent output

**Example:**
```
Template Structure:
1. Introduction (Required)
2. Understanding the Concept (Required)
3. How It Works (Required)
...
```

### 4. **Constraint System** (Safety Training)

**Location**: `lib/ai/constraints.ts`

**Forbidden Phrases:**
- "we recommend"
- "you should"
- "best option"
- etc.

**Validation:**
- Every AI output is validated
- Forbidden phrases are flagged
- Content requires human review

## 📊 Training Data Sources (Knowledge Base)

The AI is "trained" through prompts that reference:

1. **Regulatory Knowledge:**
   - SEBI guidelines and circulars
   - RBI monetary policies
   - AMFI mutual fund regulations
   - IRDAI insurance guidelines
   - Income Tax Act provisions

2. **Financial Concepts:**
   - Investment products (MFs, stocks, FDs)
   - Financial calculations (SIP, XIRR, CAGR)
   - Tax implications
   - Market operations (NSE, BSE)

3. **Content Patterns:**
   - Investopedia article structures
   - NerdWallet comparison formats
   - Best practices from top financial sites

## 🔄 Why Prompt Engineering vs Fine-Tuning?

### Prompt Engineering (What We Use) ✅

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Fast Setup**: No training time required
- ✅ **Flexible**: Easy to adjust prompts
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: No training costs
- ✅ **Up-to-Date**: Uses latest model knowledge
- ✅ **Multiple Styles**: Can switch between Investopedia/NerdWallet instantly

**How It Works:**
- System prompts guide AI behavior
- Each request includes expert instructions
- AI follows instructions for that specific request

### Fine-Tuning (Not Used)

**Would Require:**
- ❌ Training dataset (thousands of examples)
- ❌ Training time (hours/days)
- ❌ Training costs ($100s-$1000s)
- ❌ Model hosting
- ❌ Less flexible (harder to change)

**When Fine-Tuning Makes Sense:**
- Need brand-specific voice
- Have 1000s of examples
- Need consistent formatting
- Budget for training
